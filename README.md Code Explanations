Big O Notation - Mars Exploration:

The provided code counts the number of changes needed to make a message conform to a repeating "SOS" pattern. 
Its time complexity scales linearly with the message length, meaning it takes longer for longer messages. 
This is reflected in a Big O notation of O(n), as the dominant operation - iterating through the message in groups of 3 - directly depends on the input size. 
The constant-time comparisons and increments within the loops don't significantly impact this overall linear growth rate.

Plus Minus (time + space description):

The time complexity of the plusMinus function is O(n), where n represents the size of the input array arr. 
This is because the function traverses through the array once to tabulate the counts of positive, negative, and zero elements, executing a fixed number of operations for each element along the way.
In terms of space complexity, the plusMinus function operates at O(1), independent of the size of the input array. 
It achieves this by utilizing a constant number of integer variables (positiveCount, negativeCount, zeroCount), thereby ensuring a steady memory footprint. 
Additionally, it refrains from utilizing any supplementary data structures that could grow in proportion to the input size.

Maximum Subarray (recursive explanation):

The recursive algorithm provided in the code solves the Maximum Subarray problem. 

In particular, the `maxSubarray` function aims to find two values for a given array `arr`:
1. The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (maximum subarray sum).
2. The maximum sum of a subsequence (maximum subsequence sum).

These two values are computed using separate functions:
- `maxSubarraySum`: This function calculates the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm, 
which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the given array.
- `maxSubsequenceSum`: This function calculates the maximum subsequence sum, which is the sum of 
elements in a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) that yields the maximum sum among all possible subsequences. 
It iterates through the array and handles positive and negative numbers to compute this sum.

Therefore, the recursive algorithm is designed to solve the Maximum Subarray problem by providing both 
the maximum subarray sum and the maximum subsequence sum for a given input array.


Recursive explanation for Coin Change:
Base Case: If the target amount for making change is 0, there exists precisely one method to achieve this, 
which is by opting not to use any coins. If the target amount is negative, it implies there are no viable ways to make change, thus returning 0.
Recursive Case: When evaluating each coin within the available set, two choices present themselves:
1. Utilize the current coin: Subtract the value of the current coin from the target amount and 
recursively determine the count of ways to make change for the updated amount using the same set of coins.
2. Exclude the current coin: Proceed to the next coin in the set without altering the target amount and 
recursively ascertain the number of ways to make change for the same amount utilizing the remaining coins.
