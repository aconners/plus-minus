Big O Notation - Mars Exploration:

The provided code counts the number of changes needed to make a message conform to a repeating "SOS" pattern. 
Its time complexity scales linearly with the message length, meaning it takes longer for longer messages. 
This is reflected in a Big O notation of O(n), as the dominant operation - iterating through the message in groups of 3 - directly depends on the input size. 
The constant-time comparisons and increments within the loops don't significantly impact this overall linear growth rate.

Plus Minus (time + space description)

The time complexity of the plusMinus function is O(n), where n represents the size of the input array arr. 
This is because the function traverses through the array once to tabulate the counts of positive, negative, and zero elements, executing a fixed number of operations for each element along the way.
In terms of space complexity, the plusMinus function operates at O(1), independent of the size of the input array. 
It achieves this by utilizing a constant number of integer variables (positiveCount, negativeCount, zeroCount), thereby ensuring a steady memory footprint. 
Additionally, it refrains from utilizing any supplementary data structures that could grow in proportion to the input size.
